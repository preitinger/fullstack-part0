title 0.6 - Adding note in single page app

user->browser: enter text in text field
user->browser: enter key or click on save button
note over browser:
browser collects data from the form and generates an onsubmit event,
i.e. calls callback in Javascript.
Javascript code reads value of form element and
creates a new note object,
adds it to the notes array,
redraws the notes in the array by manipulating the DOM,
creates POST XMLHttpRequest with content and date of the new note
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
note over server:
server adds the new note to its own list, so its available
when next user opens the page (and therefore its browser requests data.json as in 0.5).
end note
server-->browser: HTTP response with json {"message":"note created"}
note over browser
browser sets the responseText in the XMLHttpRequest object and calls the callback for status change,
there javascript logs the response text to console
end note
